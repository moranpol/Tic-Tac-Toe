# Tic Tac Toe
## About:
Tic Tac Toe is a project developed as part of a second-year C# course, focusing on object-oriented programming (OOP) principles and design concepts. 
This project introduces a unique variation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game, where losing occurs when a diagonal row or column is formed.

## Features
* Variety of Board Sizes: Choose from a range of board sizes, from 3x3 to 9x9, offering different levels of complexity.
* Unique Winning Condition: Instead of the traditional three-in-a-row, players lose when a diagonal row or column is formed.
  
## Phases:
* Console-Based Implementation: Initially, the project started with a command-line interface version of the game, offering a simple and straightforward gameplay experience.
* Desktop Application: Later in the project's development, a desktop application version with a graphical user interface (GUI) was introduced. This version enhances the user experience with visual elements and interactivity.

## Gameplay
1. Select the desired board size at the start of the game.
2. Players take turns placing their marks (X or O) on the board.
3. The game continues until a diagonal row or column is formed, leading to a loss for the player who made the last move.
