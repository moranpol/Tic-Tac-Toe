# Tic-Tac-Toe

In my second year of the C# course, I undertook a project that involved utilizing object-oriented programming (OOP) principles and design concepts. The project focused on creating a unique variation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game called "X Mix Drix" but with a twist - losing occurs when a diagonal row or column is formed. The game board ranged in size from 3x3 to 9x9. I implemented two versions of the game: the first version was a console-based implementation, while the second version featured a windowed interface.
